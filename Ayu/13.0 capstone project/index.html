                learn the different things in my spare time and with the help of that i have developed some of the 
                skills too. I have a love toward the outdoor activities and i spend my most of the outdoor time in
                 playing. what i hate is wasting my time by just sitting at a place , i love motion, the activities
                 , i want something each second and with that curiosity i have choosen to make my career in Electronics
                 as it is a dyanamic, diverse and my lovable branch of engineering.
